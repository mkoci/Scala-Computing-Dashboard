## Project Summary
For Part 1:
I created the sidebar using create-react-app. I may have wasted too much time using [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) for the components and icons, though it was interesting to learn.

The vanilla javascript for Parts 2-5 are located in /public/files.js, The file navigator allows for 1 level of file depth. Unfortunately, I did not sanitize dates to make them sortable (would use a module like date-fns in React).

The only thing that may not be obvious is you have to press 'Root /' to go to root level or cancel a search.


## To get started:

### `npm install`
### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

Open [http://localhost:4000/files](http://localhost:4000/files) to use the vanilla js file UI.
